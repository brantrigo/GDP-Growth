Gross domestic product (GDP) is a monetary measure of the market value
of all the final goods and services produced in a specific time period. GDP is
often used as a metric for international comparisons as well as a broad measure
of economic progress. It is often considered to be the "world’s most powerful
statistical indicator of national development and progress".
You are provided with a dataset containing over a thousand annual indicators of economic development (including GDP and GDP growth) in hundreds of
countries around the world from 1960 to 2010, and you are asked to develop a
model that can predict GDP growth using data from the past. You can use all the
variables that you want from previous years, and you can use the model that you
feel it is going to work better. The aim is to have a model that can predict next
year GDP growth for each country in the world using the available data.
